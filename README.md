  # About
  
  This project was made as part of the "Gaming Jam" Course of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem &  Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design.
    
  This project was the first assignment of the course. We were asked to create a flappy bird inspired game.
  
  I decided to combine the familiar flappy bird mechanics with some shooter mechanics.
  
  Working on this game took one day of consecutive work.
