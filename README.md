  # About
  
  The project was made as part of the "Gaming Jam" Course of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem &  Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design.
    
  That was the first assignment of the course, and we were asked to create a flappy bird inspired game.
  
  I decided to combine the familiar flappy bird mechanics with some shooter mechanics.
  
  Working on this game took one day of consecutive work.
